# About

Biological sex is an independent risk factor for many diseases, their progression, and their respective biomarkers. Examples include **coronary artery disease**, **chronic kidney disease**, and **Alzheimer's disease**. Also **immune response** and inflammatory pathways differ between men and women. 

Within this project, I plan to analyse (hormonal) sex differences in multiple OMICS levels as well as complex diseases. Hormone levels highly depend on phase of life, with changes during **puberty** in both sexes, and **menopause** and the **menstrual cycle** in women. Hence, I will also include data from longitudinal studies and expand cross-sectional studies with data from electronic health records.
