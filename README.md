# Steroid Hormone Action and its variabilitY (SHAY)

_last updated: 28/04/2025_

In this repository, I want to save the data management plan for the steroid hormone analyses, and create a github webpage with all relevant cohorts used in the project. 

## Data management plan 

Aim: document here all data sources used in SHAY

- cohort/consortium name
- data freeze
- download link and date
- cohort description (link to paper)
- meta-information of GWAS (genetic control, sample size & case-control numbers, filtering for MAF)
- code for QC of harmonization per cohort (SNP-ID, lift-over, allele harmonization, column names)

## Webpage

- **About**: summary and contact information
- **Data**:
    - summary of cohorts: name, ethnicity, age range at baseline, number of time points, link to cohort description publication
    - summary of publicly available summary statistics: name, ethnicity, hormone, sample size
- **Hormones**:
    - overview of all relevant hormones included in SHAY
    - summary of sample sizes per hormone and cohort
