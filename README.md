# Steroid Hormone Action and its variabilitY (SHAY)

_last updated: 01/08/2025_

In this repository, I want to save the **data management plan** (DMP) for my SHAY project, and in addition list all relevant cohorts used in this or related projects regarding steroid hormone analyses. 

## Data management plan for SHAY

_will be updated when the project starts_

Aim: document here all data sources used in SHAY

- cohort/consortium name
- data freeze
- download link and date
- cohort description (link to paper)
- meta-information of GWAS (genetic control, sample size & case-control numbers, filtering for MAF)
- code for QC of harmonization per cohort (SNP-ID, lift-over, allele harmonization, column names)

## General information, cohorts and publicly available data for steroid hormone projects 

Please check this [overview](./docs/index.html)

- **About**: summary of project and contact information
- **Data**:
    - summary of cohorts: name, ethnicity, age range at baseline, number of time points, link to cohort description publication
